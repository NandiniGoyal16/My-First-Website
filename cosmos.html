          Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity. They are the fundamental building blocks of galaxies, including our Milky Way.</p>
          <p class="centered-text">These celestial objects emit light and energy due to nuclear reactions occurring in their cores. The light from stars illuminates the cosmos and allows us to observe the universe.</p>
          <p class="centered-text">Stars vary in size, temperature, color, and lifespan. They are classified based on their spectral characteristics, such as O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, each representing different temperature and color.</p>
          <p class="centered-text">Throughout history, stars have played a crucial role in navigation, with ancient civilizations using them for celestial navigation and creating constellations to navigate the seas or mark the changing seasons.</p>
          <p class="centered-text">Modern astronomy continues to explore and study stars, unraveling their mysteries, life cycles, and contributions to the evolution of galaxies.</p>
